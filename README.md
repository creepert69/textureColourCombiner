# Texture Colour Combiner

This is a tool I created to combine texture files based on the filenames in the source folder.

** It requires 3 components : **
- Source folder
- Destination folder
- Base texture 

## What do these components mean?
- Source folder : Contains the texture maps for differently coloured maps.
- Destination folder : This is where the final combined maps of different colours will be stored. 
- Base Texture : This is the base texutre which remains constant 
**NOTE : All textures have to have an alpha map by default to blend correctly**

## How to use it?
- Firstly, select your source folder. 
- Select your destination folder.
- Select your base map
- Click on combine!!

## Future imporvements : 
- UI tweaks (making it more informative)
- Drag and drop folder selection
- Support for multiple base textures
